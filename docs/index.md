# Jooby Hut
Welcome to Jooby Hut, a place that keeps track of the interesting stuff I've been working on. Right now it's a bit empty as I'm just getting started, but I'll keep on updating the content when I can. Projects with a `*` indicates the page is not finished. Hopefully I'll be able to properly document everything what I've been working on these years soon!

# Currently Active
[Salmon*](Salmon.md) (2024 Sep - 2024 Dec)

A 3D racing/adventure game developed using `Unity` game engine. This is the course project for the game design course CSC404 Fall at University of Toronto. I took part in implementing a little bit of everything with special emphasis on procedural mesh/collider generation for the map.

# Personal Projects
Down below are some projects I've been working on alone 97-100% of the time. 
## [Clash Steels*](ClashSteels.md) and [Lobster Framework](https://dicespinner.github.io/LobsterFramework/) (2022 April - Present)

Clash Steels is a Top Down 2D action game being developed using the `Unity` game engine. A couple months into development I decided to abstract out some tools and gameplay systems and put them in a different assembly which I call Lobster Framework in order to reuse features for future game projects.

## [Lobster-Remake](LobsterRemake.md) (2021 May - 2021 Sep)
A remake of the 2D Top Down dungeon exploration game I've developed in Grade 11 using `pygame`. More information and clips of this game are available on the github repo. The project started after my first year at University of Toronto doing computer science by the moltivation of putting the knowledge I newly gained to test. In the four months I had in summer I managed to implement the majority of the gameplay features from the original game with greatly improved flexibility, as well as some new features. 

# Group Projects
## [Salmon*](Salmon.md) (2024 Sep - 2024 Dec)

A 3D racing/adventure game developed using `Unity` game engine. This is the course project for the game design course CSC404 Fall at University of Toronto. I took part in implementing a little bit of everything with special emphasis on procedural mesh/collider generation for the map.

## [Grow Big Or Go Home*](https://leyza.itch.io/grow-big-or-go-home) (2023 Nov - 2023 Dec)

A 3D action/adventure game developed using `Unity` game engine. This is the submission for the 2023 [`Big Mode Game Jam`](https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-2023). I was mainly involved in implementing entity behaviors, navigation for large number of agents and visual effects for vehicle crushing, explosion and flame.
