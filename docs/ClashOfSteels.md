## Clash of Steels

**Clash of Steels** is a top-down 2D action game developed in **Unity (C#)**. Designed to emulate the precision and tactical intensity of *Sekiro*, it implements a physics-driven combat system with posture mechanics and weighted interactions. The project is also a testbed for **Lobster Framework**, a modular toolkit I created to streamline gameplay architecture, editor workflows, and runtime pooling in Unity.

This combination allowed me to explore a different style of gameplay engineering compared to my low-level C++ projects â€” this time leveraging Unity's ecosystem while still aiming for control and reusability in core systems.

## Combat Mechanics

The game features a dual-resource combat system â€” **Health** and **Posture**. Both reduced on taking hits. 

If health is depleted, the character immediately dies.

If posture is broken, the character becomes immobilized, creating an opportunity for follow-up strikes. This introduces a rhythm of offensive and defensive maneuvers similar to *Sekiro* but implemented through continuous physics rather than scripted animations.

The character is able to perform the following actions:

- Weapon Switch (Left): Switch the offhand weapon
- Weapon Switch (Right): Switch the mainhand weapon
- Block: Raise weapon to enter defense stance
- Light Attack: Perform a quick attack with the mainhand weapon
- Charged Attack: Perform a charged attack with the mainhand weapon
  - Can hold to charge and increase damage
  - Has max charge time, will attack automatically when fully charged
- Weapon Art (Weapon dependant)
  - Perform the equipped weapon art of the current mainhand weapon
- 8 Directional Move 
- 8 Directional Dash
- Rotate view, used in conjuection with move and dash for omni-directional movement

The effect of actions:

- Attacks will swing the weapon equipped in main(right) hand and will reduce the enemy posture and health on hit
  - Health damage is determined by **weapon sharpness**
  - Posture damage is determined by **weapon weight**
- Blocking mitigates health loss and reduces posture damage based on the difference between the sum of self **character weight** plus self **weapon weight** and enemy **weapon weight**. The heavier the
- Attacks apply knockback based on **weapon weight**.
- If the character hits terrain (walls) at high velocity, posture damage will be taken
- **Character weight** acts as both a knockback resistance and a movement speed penalty.

Rather than relying on baked animations to simulate hit reactions, all impact responses are computed using Unityâ€™s 2D physics engine. This makes weapon swings, knockbacks, and stuns feel more grounded and dynamically reactive.

## Evolution into Lobster Framework

**Clash of Steels** originally began as a standalone Unity project. As development progressed, I realized that many core gameplay systems â€” such as object pooling, runtime state management, and debugging tools â€” required significant time and effort to build. To improve efficiency and reduce duplication in future Unity projects, I began extracting these systems into a reusable module, which evolved into **Lobster Framework**.

This framework was born directly out of the needs of *Clash of Steels*, and many of its systems were first tested and validated in this game before being generalized into standalone tools.

### Design Goals

- Deliver the feel of weighty, reactive combat through real-time physics.
- Support clear feedback loops: posture break, slow-down effects, impact stun.
- Avoid animation lock-ins â€” use dynamic systems for movement and response.
- Establish reusable Unity systems for future projects via Lobster Framework.
