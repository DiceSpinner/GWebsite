## Welcome

Hi! I'm Mike Yuan. A student developer with a strong interest in game development, systems programming, real-time interaction, and understanding how things work at a fundamental level.

This site showcases a growing collection of projects â€” from interactive applications to low-level infrastructure â€” each built as part of my journey toward mastering software development from the ground up. I enjoy working close to the hardware, building things that run fast, and learning what happens behind the abstractions.

Many of my projects explore game development and graphical systems, while more recent ones branch into topics like custom engines, networking, and embedded programming. Across all of them, my focus remains the same: writing clear, efficient code and gaining insight into the layers that make modern computing possible.

## Featured Projects
### [Fruit Ninja Clone](FruitNinja.md) â€” *C++/OpenGL* (2024 Dec â€“ Present)
A complete recreation of the original Fruit Ninja arcade game, built from the ground up in C++ with modern OpenGL. It includes a custom rendering engine, real-time audio system using OpenAL, coroutine-based logic flow, and an in-progress **multiplayer mode over a custom UDP protocol**.

### [Clash of Steels](ClashSteels.md) + [Lobster Framework](https://dicespinner.github.io/LobsterFramework/) â€” *Unity/C#* (2022 â€“ Present)
A top-down 2D action game. Along the way, I created **Lobster Framework**, a reusable Unity module for gameplay systems, editor tools, and object pooling, for my future Unity projects.

### [Lobster Remake](LobsterRemake.md) â€” *Python/Pygame* (2021 Summer)
A modern reimplementation of a high-school dungeon crawler I made, this time applying real software design principles. Focused on modularity and flexibility.

## Group Projects

### [Salmon](Salmon.md) â€” *Unity* (2024 Fall)
3D racing/adventure game developed for the UofT CSC404 Game Design course. I focused on **procedural generation** of mesh colliders for terrain.

### [Grow Big Or Go Home](https://leyza.itch.io/grow-big-or-go-home) â€” *Unity* (2023 Game Jam)
3D action game developed in a team during a month-long jam. I handled agent behavior, large-scale navmesh traversal, and dramatic visual effects.

Stay tuned â€” more write-ups and playable builds coming soon.
