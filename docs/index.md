# Jooby Hut
Welcome to Jooby Hut, a place that keeps track of the interesting stuff I've been working on. Right now it's a bit empty as I'm just getting started, but I'll keep on updating the content when I can. Projects with a `*` indicates the page is not finished. Hopefully I'll be able to properly document everything what I've been working on these years soon!

# Personal Projects
Down below are some projects I've been working on alone 97-100% of the time. 
## [Clash Steels*](ClashSteels.md) and [Lobster Framework](https://dicespinner.github.io/LobsterFramework/) (2022 April - Present)

Clash Steels is a Top Down 2D action game being developed using the Unity game engine. A couple months into development I decided to abstract out some tools and gameplay systems and put them in a different assembly which I call Lobster Framework in order to reuse features for future game projects.

## [Lobster-Remake](LobsterRemake.md) (2021 May - 2021 Sep)
A remake of the 2D Top Down dungeon exploration game I've developed in Grade 11 using pygame. More information and clips of this game are available on the github repo. The project started after my first year at University of Toronto doing computer science by the moltivation of putting the knowledge I newly gained to test. In the four months I had in summer I managed to implement the majority of the gameplay features from the original game with greatly improved flexibility, as well as some new features.
